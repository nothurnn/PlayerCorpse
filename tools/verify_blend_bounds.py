"""
Standalone numerical re-implementation of BlendedTextureCache.blend()'s pixel
math (lerpPixel/compositeOver/pack, and the new base-bounds clamping), run
against synthetic images shaped like the real crash: a 64x64 stageLow/stageHigh
pair (ash_N.png format) composited onto a 64x32 base (skeleton.png's actual
legacy mob-texture format). This environment can't launch Minecraft or call
the real Java code, so this is the closest available check that the new
clamping logic (a) never indexes outside the base image's real bounds and
(b) produces a correctly-sized, fully-opaque result - the two properties the
crash report showed were violated before the fix.
