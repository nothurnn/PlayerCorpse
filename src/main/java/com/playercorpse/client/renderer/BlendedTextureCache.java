/**
 * Single-draw-call crossfade between two source stage textures, premixed
 * pixel-by-pixel on the CPU, cached per (entity, slot) and only regenerated
 * when (stageLow, stageHigh, frac, baseTexture) actually changes - in
 * practice once per tick at most, since phase progress only changes on tick
 * boundaries. Shared by the shroud erosion crossfade and the ash overlay
 * (RECOVERY.md section 7).
 *
 * WHY this exists, not just what it does: the historical "shroud flickers
 * back and forth for months" bug came from drawing two overlapping
 * translucent layers per frame - a low-stage and a high-stage texture with
 * complementary vertex alpha - to fake a crossfade. The GPU's draw order
 * between those two calls was never guaranteed, so which one painted on top
 * varied frame to frame, and the visible result flickered between the two
 * orderings. Blending the two source images into one real texture ahead of
 * time and issuing a single opaque-alpha draw call removes the ordering
 * question entirely, because there is only one draw call. It is also more
 * correct in its own right: the old two-draw approach's overlapping
 * complementary alphas mathematically bottom out around 75% combined opacity
 * at the midpoint of the fade (two non-fully-opaque layers can't sum past
 * that under standard "over" blending the way two DIFFERENT alpha values
 * would), which read as an unwanted dip in solidity exactly when the
 * crossfade should look most "in-between", not less present.
 *
 * When baseTexture is supplied, the blended (stageLow/stageHigh/frac) image
 * is composited fully opaquely onto it via standard "src-over" alpha
 * compositing, rather than returned as its own semi-transparent image - this
 * is how the ash overlay avoids being a second transparent layer stacked on
 * top of the skeleton texture ("Ergebnis vollständig deckend, kein eigener
 * Layer").
 *
 * Accepted downside, per RECOVERY.md: the final blended texture generated
 * for a given (entity, slot) stays resident on the GPU for the rest of the
 * client session after that entity is removed, because RenderLayer has no
 * "entity removed" hook to trigger cleanup - a few KB per corpse. Every
 * regeneration WHILE the entity is alive properly releases its own previous
 * texture first (see getOrCreate below), so this leak is bounded to one
 * texture per (entity, slot) that ever existed, not one per tick.
